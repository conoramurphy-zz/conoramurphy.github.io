        I'm a guy in Dublin looking to build products a better way. I have a <a href="/ConorM-CV.pdf">history of designing and building</a> simple, beautiful products while refining the method of building them. You can also check out my in-progress <a href="#Portfolio">portfolio</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should <a href="mailto:conormurphy@outlook.com?Subject=Hey%20Conor">say hello</a>. I'm open to short and longer term opportunities in design and product development work (especially focusing on early apps/MVP completion in startups). Or hey, even a coffee about anything that's on your mind.
      </p>

        I also <a href="https://medium.com/@aguycalledconor">write about these issues</a> I've encountered and am thinking about from time to time.
