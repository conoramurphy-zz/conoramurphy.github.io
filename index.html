      I'm a guy in Dublin looking to build product a better way. I <a href="/ConorM-CV.pdf">have a history</a> of trying to design and build products in simpler and more effective ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should <a href="mailto:conormurphy@outlook.com?Subject=Hey%20Conor">say hello</a>. I'm open to short and longer term opportunities in design and product development work (especially focusing on early apps/MVP completion in startups). Or hey, even a coffee about anything that's on your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also <a href="/thoughts/">write about these issues</a> I've encountered and am thinking about from time to time.
