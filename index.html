        I'm a guy in Dublin looking to build products a better way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a <a href="/ConorM-CV.pdf">history of designing and building</a> simple, beautiful products while refining the method of building them. You can also check out my in-progress <a href="#Portfolio">portfolio</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should <a href="mailto:conormurphy@outlook.com?Subject=Hey%20Conor">say hello</a>. I'm open to any opportunities in design and product development work (especially focusing on MVP design and development sprints in startups). 
      </p>
      <p>
        I also <a href="https://medium.com/@aguycalledconor">write </a> from time to time.
