      I'm a guy in Dublin looking to build product a better way. I <a href="/ConorM-CV.pdf">have a history</a> of looking towards better and simpler ways of building and designing products.

      You should <a href="mailto:conormurphy@outlook.com?Subject=Hey%20Conor">say hello</a>. I'm open to short-term product development work (especially focusing on MVP completion in startups) or talking about an idea or longer term opportunities you might have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also <a href="/thoughts/">write about these issues</a> from time to time.
