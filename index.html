      I'm a guy in Dublin looking to build product a better way. I <a href="/me/">have a history</a> of looking towards better and simpler ways of building and designing products.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should <a href="conormurphy@outlook.com">say hello</a>. I'm open to short-term product development work (especially focusing on MVP completion in startups) or talking about an idea or intersting longer term opportunities you might have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also <a href="/thoughts/">write about these issues</a> from time to time.
